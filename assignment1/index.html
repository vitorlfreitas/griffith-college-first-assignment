                <p class="main__info--paragraph">Hello there! My name is Vitor Freitas. I am 23 years old and Brazilian. I have been studying software development for over a year. I used to be a bartender in Brazil, which was a great time, I could swap stories and ideas with interesting folks.</p>
                <p class="main__info--paragraph">Getting a degree is crucial for my personal life, I know that it will be challenging, and I also feel a bit rusty, but that is part of the game, I am loving every minute of it.</p>
                <p class="main__info--paragraph">Here in Cork, I usually spend my time working or studying. I love to study and learn new things. I could not see myself studying another degree than Computer Science, I feel that this degree will make me use 100% of my capacity, I really believe I am good at that and I will change my life with that.</p>
